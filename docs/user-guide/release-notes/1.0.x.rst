Pulp OSTree 1.0 Release Notes
=============================

Pulp OSTree 1.0.0
=================

New Features
------------

The Pulp team is pleased to release version 1.0.0 of the OSTree plugins for Pulp.
These plugins provide support for OSTree repositories. Once the repository has been created
and configured with a feed, branches can be pulled from a remote OSTree repository. Each pulled
branch HEAD is stored as a content unit and associated with the repository. The actual
trees are stored in a native OSTree repository. Content units can be copied between repositories.
Publishing creates a new OSTree repository that is populated using OSTree *local-pull* of those
commits specified by content units. The published repository contains *refs* for each branch
and a summary file is generated.
