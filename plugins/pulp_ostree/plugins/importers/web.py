        Import content units into the given repository. This method will be

           into the repository that uses this importer
         * A user is attempting to add an orphaned unit into a repository.

        This call has two options for handling the requested units:
         * Associate the given units with the destination repository. This will
           link the repository with the existing unit directly; changes to the
           unit will be reflected in all repositories that reference it.

           a deep copy of sorts, creating a unique unit in the database. Keep
           in mind that the unit key must change in order for the unit to
           be considered different than the supplied one.

        The APIs for both approaches are similar to those in the sync conduit.
        In the case of a simple association, the init_unit step can be skipped
        and save_unit simply called on each specified unit.

        The units argument is optional. If None, all units in the source
        repository should be imported. The conduit is used to query for those
